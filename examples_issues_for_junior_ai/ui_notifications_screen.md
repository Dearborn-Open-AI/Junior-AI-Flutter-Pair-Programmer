## Issue Title
Junior AI: Design UI for Notifications Screen

## Issue Description
We need to design the UI for the Notifications Screen, providing users with an organized, clear view of their notifications.
1. List Layout: Display notifications in a list format, with the most recent notifications at the top.
2. Notification Card: Each notification should be in a card format, displaying the message, time, and a relevant icon.
3. Read/Unread Indicator: Differentiate between read and unread notifications, possibly using color, font weight, or an icon.
4. Interactivity: Each notification card should have a clear touchable area. Include visual feedback (like a ripple effect) when a notification is tapped.
5. Action Buttons: Add a 'Mark as Read' button/icon and a 'Clear' button/icon for each notification. Also, include a 'Clear All' button at the top of the screen.
