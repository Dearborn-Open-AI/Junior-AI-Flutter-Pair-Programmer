Junior AI: Design UI for Profile Screen

## Issue Description
We need to design a new Profile Screen UI to provide users with a visually appealing and intuitive interface to view and edit their personal details.
1. Layout: The screen should have clearly defined sections for profile picture, personal details (e.g., name, email), and edit actions.
2. Profile Picture: Centrally position the user's profile picture with an option to change it. If no image is available, display a default avatar.
3. User Details: Display user details like name and email in an easily readable font size. Incorporate intuitive icons next to email and other details.
4. Edit Mode: On entering edit mode, fields should change to editable text boxes, with visible Save and Cancel buttons.
5. Feedback: On successful edits, visual feedback (like a brief color change or animation) should notify the user.
