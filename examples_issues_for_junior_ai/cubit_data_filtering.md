## Issue Title
Junior AI: Create a Data Filtering Cubit

## Issue Description
We need a Data Filtering Cubit to handle states in cases where data needs to be filtered based on user preferences. 
1. Data Fetching: The Cubit should fetch the necessary data from our backend.
2. Filter Application: The Cubit should apply filters based on user-selected criteria.
3. State Management: The Cubit should emit new states containing the filtered data, allowing the UI to rebuild with the updated data.
4. Error Handling: Any issues during the fetching or filtering processes should be appropriately handled and communicated to the user.
