## Issue Title
Junior AI: Develop API Client for a Chat App

## Issue Description
Our chat functionalities require a specific API client to facilitate interaction with our backend. This API client will be instrumental in handling chat and user data.
Main objectives:
1. Create API Client: Develop an API client that leverages suitable HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate with our RESTful backend.
2. Connect to Chat and User Endpoints: The API client should interact with the following endpoints:
   - GET /chats: Retrieve all active chat conversations.
   - POST /chats: Start a new chat conversation.
   - GET /chats/{id}: Fetch a specific chat conversation.
   - GET /users: Retrieve all registered users.
   - GET /users/{id}: Fetch a specific user's details.
3. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage potential problems during API
