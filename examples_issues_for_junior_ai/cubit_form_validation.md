## Issue Title
Junior AI: Create a Form Validation Cubit

## Issue Description
In our ongoing efforts to enhance user experience, we need a Form Validation Cubit to manage and validate user input effectively in our forms.
1. Input Monitoring: The Cubit should monitor form input fields and validate data as the user types.
2. Input Validation: The Cubit should use suitable validation rules for each form field, marking fields as invalid if they fail validation.
3. State Management: The Cubit should emit new states based on the validation results, enabling or disabling the form submission button as needed.
4. Error Handling: Proper error handling should be implemented to provide useful validation feedback to the user.
