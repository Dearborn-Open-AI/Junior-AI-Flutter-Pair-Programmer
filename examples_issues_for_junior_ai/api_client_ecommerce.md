## Issue Title
Junior AI: Develop API Client for an E-commerce app

## Issue Description
The app needs a dedicated API client to ensure seamless interaction with the backend. This API client will be crucial for managing product data.
Main objectives:
1. Create API Client: Build an API client that uses the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with our RESTful backend.
2. Connect to Product Endpoints: The API client should interact with the following endpoints:
   - GET /products: Fetch all available products.
   - POST /products: Add new products.
   - PUT /products/{id}: Update details of a specific product.
   - DELETE /products/{id}: Remove a specific product.
3. Error Handling: Implement efficient error handling to manage potential issues during API communication.
