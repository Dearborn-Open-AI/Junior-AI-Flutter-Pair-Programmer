## Issue Title
Junior AI: Create a BLoC for Handling E-Commerce Categories

## Issue Description
Our Flutter app requires a dedicated BLoC for managing the various e-commerce categories effectively.
1. List all Categories: The BLoC should be able to fetch and handle a list of all current categories from our backend.
2. Category Selection: Users should be able to select a specific category and the BLoC should manage the state of this selection.
3. Update Category List: The BLoC should provide a mechanism to update the category list when new categories are added or existing ones are removed/updated in the backend.
4. Handle Errors: Proper error handling should be implemented to deal with any issues arising from API calls or data issues.
