## Issue Description**
In order to ensure consistency and visual appeal across our app, we need to establish a Text Theme and Color Scheme.
#### Text Theme: Typography Guidelines 
1. Font Family: A modern sans-serif font that is legible at all sizes.
2. Display:
   - Font size: Large and dominant for page titles.
   - Weight: Bold for emphasis.
   - Letter Spacing: Slightly spaced for readability.
3. Headline:
   - Font size: Moderately large for subheadings.
   - Weight: Slightly bolder than regular text, but less than Display.
   - Letter Spacing: Normal spacing.
4. Body:
   - Font size: Comfortable reading size for extended content.
   - Weight: Regular for standard content.
   - Letter Spacing: Regular spacing for ease of reading.
5. Caption:
   - Font size: Smaller than body text for auxiliary information.
   - Weight: Lighter than regular content.
   - Letter Spacing: Slightly increased spacing to offset smaller size.

#### Color Scheme
1. Primary Color: A vibrant shade that resonates with the brand identity.
   - Lighter variant: A muted version of the primary color for backgrounds or hover effects.
   - Darker variant: A deeper shade of the primary color for emphasis or depth.
2. Secondary Color: A contrasting color to the primary which complements it without overshadowing.
   - Lighter variant: A paler shade of the secondary color.
   - Darker variant: A richer tone of the secondary color for variation.
3. Error Color: A color that clearly signifies errors, preferably a shade of red.
4. Background Color: A neutral hue that complements the primary and secondary colors and offers a clean backdrop for content.
