Junior AI: Create an Auth BLoC for User Authentication

## Issue Description
In order to ensure a secure user experience in our Flutter app, we require an Auth BLoC to handle user authentication effectively.
1. User Sign Up: The BLoC should support new user registration, validating user input and communicating with the backend to create a new user account.
2. User Sign In: The BLoC should facilitate user login by accepting user credentials, verifying them with the backend, and managing the user session.
3. User Sign Out: Users should be able to end their sessions securely. The BLoC should handle sign-out requests and properly terminate the user session.
3. Handle Errors: Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and address potential issues during the authentication process.
