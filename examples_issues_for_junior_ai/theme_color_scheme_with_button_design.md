## Issue Title
Junior AI: Design a Fluo Color Scheme and Style Key Widgets

## Issue Description
To enhance our app's visual appeal and ensure uniformity, we need a vibrant fluo color scheme and specific styling for key widgets.
### Fluo Color Scheme
Primary Color: #FF5C83 (Vibrant Pink)
Lighter variant: #FF8AB1
Darker variant: #FF2961
Secondary Color: #33FF57 (Neon Green)
Lighter variant: #66FF80
Darker variant: #00CC44
Error Color: #FF4343 (Bright Red)
Background Color: #FAFAFA (Soft Gray)

The app needs a standard styling for the following widgets:
### FilledButton:  
The button is dressed in a lively pink with soft gray text. On hover, this pink takes on a deeper tone. Sized comfortably, its rounded edges enhance its elegant look.

### ElevatedButton:  
Sporting a neon green hue, this button features crisp white text. It has a subtle lift when pressed, and its color intensifies on hover. Standard in size, its rounded corners complete its polished design.

### AppBar:  
The AppBar shines in a deeper shade of pink, paired with a pure white title. Its icons pop in a neon green, and a slight shadow graces its base, adding a touch of depth.
