## Getting Started with Junior AI
Welcome to Junior AI! Streamline your development process with our intelligent coding AI. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.


### Step 1: Connect Junior AI to Your GitHub Repository
Before diving into the capabilities of Junior AI, it's paramount to establish a seamless connection between it and your GitHub repository. This vital connection empowers Junior AI with the permissions it requires to peruse, amend, and contribute to your project codebase.

**How to Connect:**
1. **Start on GitHub:** Begin your journey by heading over to the **Junior AI GitHub App page**. Think of it as the gateway to integrating AI capabilities into your workflow.
   
2. **Initiate the Integration:** Once on the app page, find the '**Install**' or '**Add to Repository**' button. Clicking on this button sets the integration process in motion.

3. **Select Your Repository:** A list showcasing all your repositories will pop up. From this list, cherry-pick the repository or repositories you wish Junior AI to lend its expertise to.

4. **Proceed to Junior's Home Base:** Post this selection, you'll be seamlessly redirected to [junior.atomsbox.com](https://junior.atomsbox.com). If you haven't already, you will need to create an account here. This account becomes your primary touchpoint for managing and monitoring Junior AI's contributions.

5. **Link Your GitHub:** Once logged in or signed up, you'll be prompted to register your GitHub account. It's a simple process â€” just input your GitHub username. This step forms the bridge ensuring Junior AI recognizes and interacts with your chosen repositories.

6. **Complete the Setup:** After linking your GitHub, a few final on-screen instructions will guide you. Following them ensures that the integration is both smooth and complete.

ðŸŽ‰ **Voila!** Once you've navigated these steps, Junior AI stands ready and raring to contribute to your GitHub repository!

## Step 2: Define the Scope of Work by Creating an Issue

For optimal results with Junior AI, it's imperative to clearly define your task or problem within a GitHub issue. This serves as Junior AI's instruction manual, ensuring it fully grasps your requirements.

### How to Create an Issue:
1. **Access Issues:** Navigate to the '**Issues**' tab in your chosen repository.
2. **Initiate a Task:** Click the '**New Issue**' button.
3. **Write the Title:** Begin your title with "**Junior AI:**", followed by a concise descriptor. This prefix is of utmost importance. Issues without this prefix will go unnoticed by Junior, and as a result, no code will be generated.
4. **Elaborate in the Description:** The description is your canvas. Paint a detailed picture of your needs, embedding any relevant data, context, or resources. The better Junior AI understands, the more tailored its solution will be.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** The precision and thoroughness of your issue description determine the quality of Junior AI's output. To get a feel for writing effective descriptions, peruse our [collection of issue examples](#).

Remember, clarity is power. The more transparent and detailed you are, the more aligned and effective Junior AI's assistance will be.

## Step 3: Wait for Junior AI to Write the Code
Once the issue is created, the wheels are set in motion. Junior AI will meticulously scrutinize the task details and set out to craft a solution tailored to your Flutter codebase.

### What Happens Next:
1. **Immediate Action & Notification**: As soon as Junior AI embarks on the task, it updates the issue. It then carves out a new branch exclusively for this task. Following the completion of the coding process, the code is committed to this specific branch, and a Pull Request (PR) is initiated. To ensure you're never out of the loop, Junior dispatches an email notification post this action.
2. **Under the Hood** - The OpenAI Magic: Junior's prowess is not solely its own. It taps into the power of the OpenAI API to interpret your input and to materialize custom code solutions. This process is further refined through Flutter-specific prompt engineering and enriched with insights from a handpicked library of Flutter code. This synergy ensures the output is not only accurate but also of the highest caliber.

## Step 4: Review the Pull Request from Junior AI
Upon concluding its coding task, Junior AI will extend its results as a Pull Request (PR). This PR encapsulates all the proposed modifications and enhancements Junior AI deems fit to resolve the issued task.

### How to Review and Merge the PR:
1. **Access the PR:** Navigate to the '**Pull Requests**' tab in your GitHub repository. 
2. **Identifying Junior's PR:** Seek out the PR initiated by Junior AI. It will be distinctly marked for easy identification.
3. **Inspect the Changes:** Delve into the PR to scrutinize the alterations executed in the Flutter code. It's paramount to methodically assess each change, confirming it aligns with both your expectations and project benchmarks.
4. **Merging:** If the proposed code resonates with your requirements, proceed to merge the PR. This action integrates Junior's contributions into your primary code branch.

### Important Notes:

- **Scope of Junior's Understanding:** It's crucial to understand that Junior doesn't yet possess the capability to interpret the entirety of your repository's code (yet). As a result, there might arise scenarios necessitating manual code refinements post Junior's PR.
  
- **The Role of Junior AI:** While Junior AI showcases exemplary prowess in generating initial code drafts and automating mundane coding tasks, it's not designed to replace developers. Think of Junior as an assistant, expediting and simplifying repetitive tasks, but not substituting the nuanced expertise and judgment of a human developer. Always ensure you review PRs diligently, making certain the resultant code harmonizes with your overarching project objectives.
